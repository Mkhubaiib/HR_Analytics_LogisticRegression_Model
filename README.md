## Employee Retention Analysis

This repository contains code and datasets for analyzing employee retention. The main objective is to explore the factors that have a direct and clear impact on employee retention within a company. 

## Dataset
The employee retention dataset used for this analysis can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/giripujar/hr-analytics). It provides information about various variables related to employees, such as their salaries, departments, and retention status.

## Analysis Steps
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In this step, we perform EDA to identify the variables that have a direct and clear impact on employee retention. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to determine which factors influence employees to either leave the company or continue working.

2. Salary Impact Analysis: We visualize the impact of employee salaries on retention using bar charts. This analysis helps us understand how different salary levels relate to the likelihood of employees staying with the company.

3. Department and Retention Correlation: Bar charts are plotted to depict the correlation between departments and employee retention. This analysis provides insights into which departments have a higher retention rate and helps identify any significant patterns.

4. Logistic Regression Modeling: Using the variables narrowed down in step 1, we build a logistic regression model. This model helps predict the likelihood of employee retention based on specific factors. 

5. Model Accuracy Measurement: We measure the accuracy of the logistic regression model to evaluate its performance in predicting employee retention. This metric provides an understanding of how well the model performs and its reliability in practical scenarios.

The code and analysis in this repository provide a comprehensive understanding of employee retention factors and offer insights for making data-driven decisions to improve employee retention within an organization.
